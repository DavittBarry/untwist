# Privacy Policy for Untwist

**Last Updated**: January 18, 2026

## Overview

Untwist is a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) thought journal designed to help users track and manage their thoughts, emotions, and mental wellness. Your privacy is our top priority.

## Data Storage

**All your data stays on your device.** Untwist stores all information locally in your device's browser storage (IndexedDB). We do not:
- Collect any personal information
- Transmit any data to external servers
- Track your usage
- Use analytics or cookies
- Share your data with third parties

## What Data is Stored

The following information is stored locally on your device only:
- Thought records (situations, emotions, cognitive distortions, rational responses)
- Gratitude journal entries
- Depression checklist responses
- User preferences (theme, settings)
- Backup timestamps

## Data Control

You have complete control over your data:
- **Export**: You can export all your data as a JSON file at any time
- **Import**: You can import previously exported data
- **Delete**: You can delete individual entries or clear all data
- **Backup**: You are responsible for backing up your data

## Auto-Save Feature (Desktop Only)

On desktop browsers (Chrome/Edge), you may optionally enable an auto-save feature that saves your data to a file location you choose on your computer. This file remains entirely under your control on your local filesystem.

## Data Loss

Since all data is stored locally:
- Clearing your browser cache/data will delete all records
- Uninstalling the app will delete all data
- Switching devices will not transfer your data
- We cannot recover lost data

**We strongly recommend exporting backups regularly.**

## Third-Party Services

Untwist does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Children's Privacy

Untwist does not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13. The app is designed for adults (18+) or use under parental guidance.
